# Search Engine Optimization

## Description

This project was designed so that when anyone views the webpage, they can easily access its features. This would include the use of Chrome
Dev Tools so that when anyone views an element of the page, it is comprehensible and provides useful information on what exactly it is they're
looking at. Over the time it took me to add the semantic HTML elements to the page, and other critical features like organization and other things, I've gotten more of an extended knowledge on HTML and CSS. The page should now be accessible to people all over the internet and will make sense to other developers when they look at the code structure.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The way to use this web application is more of a base line for understanding semantic HTML elements and the way that they make viewing a webpage in Chrome Dev Tools much easier. The user can also find some information on search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. When you left click on those elements inside the header section, they will direct you to the corresponding part of the page.

## Credits

In this project, I used Xander Rapstine's "urban-octo-telegram" repository as my starter code, and built upon it to add more user friendly attributes.
